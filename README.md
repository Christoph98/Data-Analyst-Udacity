# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

As I am working through the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, I will add all of the projects in which I learned something here.

Simple project in which I used basic SQL to obtain 2 csv files containing Denver's and the World's yearly average temperature data and made a Moving Average line chart out of the two Series in Google Spreadsheets. After which I just made some small observations about the chart.
